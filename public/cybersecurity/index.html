        <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>

        <p>Cybersecurity is not just about protecting systems and networks, but also about safeguarding digital information. One essential tip for individuals is to keep software and operating systems updated. Software updates often contain patches for any known vulnerabilities that cybercriminals could exploit.</p>

        <p>Another crucial cybersecurity practice is to use strong, unique passwords for different online accounts. Relying on a password manager can make this task easier and more secure. It's also wise to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, adding an extra layer of security to your accounts.</p>

        <p>Lastly, always be vigilant about phishing attempts. Cybercriminals often use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Ensure that you are communicating securely, especially when sharing personal or confidential information, and verify the authenticity of requests before taking any action.</p>
